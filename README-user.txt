Walnut Creek Traffic Analytics Map
==================================

What This Is
-------------
A web map that shows traffic counts and related studies for the City of Walnut Creek. You can search by street, filter by year or data type, and download reports.

How to Use It
--------------
1. **Search/Filter** – Use the panel on the right to pick a data type, year(s), time period, or type a street name. The map and table update instantly.
2. **Select on the Map** – Click a location to highlight it. Filters then apply only to the highlighted sites until you click an empty area to clear the selection.
3. **Review the Table** – Scroll the table at the bottom to see detailed attributes. Columns can be sorted by clicking the header.
4. **Export** – Buttons near the top-left let you download the current table as a PDF or CSV. “Export Map PDF” captures the current map view.

FAQ
----
- **Why do I see “Loading data…”?** The map is still fetching information from the city’s database—wait a moment or check your network connection.
- **Nothing shows after filtering.** Either no records match, or you filtered a specific selection. Clear the selection or press “Reset Filters.”
- **Can I share a report?** Yes. Use the PDF or CSV export buttons, then email the file.
- **Who maintains this?** The City’s GIS/Traffic team. Contact GIS Support (<email>) for help.
